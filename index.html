        <p>I am Ian Roi Jacela Talla, a recent graduate of Stony Brook University. I have previously worked at Brookhaven National Laboratory inside the National Synchrontron Light Source II. I created the App Conversion Tool and App Discovery Tool which are meant to conveniently turn IOCs into a standardized format <a href="SNACK.html">as described by Anton Derbenev</a>. I have also created Debian 9 and Debian 10 packaging for EPICS libraries. I enjoy video games but have not played most of them - I have finished even fewer, one of which is <em>Sticker Star...</em></p>
